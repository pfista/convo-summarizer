2. Summarizes the key highlights, insights, realizations, action items, personal updates, and more
   from the call
3. Generates an audio file that summarizes the call, using openai text to speech for summary
   narration, and includes primary snippets of audio from the original conversation. 
4. Replays the call audio in an interactive UI that shows transcription matching live audio, along
   with visual cues to show who is speaking
